Hulu-Landing Page Recreation Made By Azrael-Rex-Anacleto


This is a project that will be apart of my portfolio. This project was inspired by the July 2021 version of the Hulu Landing Page. I choose to make a Hulu clone instead of a Netflix clone because I have always used and admired Hulu more than Netflix. But who know I might make a Netflix clone in the future as well.

This website is still a work in progress but I will attempt to finish as soon as possible.

The project was made with HTML,CSS and a little bit of Javascript. It won't have the functionalities that you will expect from a fullstack web app like Hulu since this is just a static site clone that I made for my personal project.

In order to run and contribute towards this Hulu Clone All you need to do is simply clone or download it as a Rar file then unzip it.

Since it was made using only HTML, CSS, and JS you won't need any NPM commands to run it.

After I complete this Hulu clone, I will host it on Vercel.
